## Akshay Jalluri: First-year Transportation Engineering Student

Hi, I am Akshay Jalluri. I was born and raised in Michigan and also did my undergrad at University of Michigan. _#GoBlue & #NationalChamps_. 


### Hobbies
  - **Mapmaking & Cartography**: Loved collecting road maps and would spend hours reading them as my hobby. I did not like reading books as a kid, so this was my alternative. Even as a toddler, I would be the one holding the folable roadmap in the back seat giving directions to my parents driving.
  - **Watching/Playing Football**: This was the first sport I was introduced to as a kid and my love for it never dissapeared. I love travelling to away games to support my team, and I also hope to be a football coach one day.
  - **Spending Family Time**: I love my parents and my older sister deeply and whenever I can I try to spend time with them. We like to sit around in the living room floor talking ot eachother, playing board games, watching Indian movies, and doing fun activities together. I also have family in Orange County whom I try to visit whenever I can and I enjoy playing with their little kids.
  - **Traveling**: I want to visit all 50 states, and I am sitting at 44 right now, with Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, New Mexico, Hawaii, and Alaska left. My favorite form of travelling is road tripping because I beleive the journey to the destination is just as fun as the destination itself. I have a laminated road map which I draw in every single freeway I have rode on.
  - **Video Games**: I play mainly on my PS4 and Nintendo Switch. My favorite games are the NHL series, Call of Duty, GTA, Uncharted, Mario Kart, and Fortnite.
  - **Cooking**: I have recently been getting into cooking, especailly after moving out to Los Angeles for my grad program. I like to cook chicken items like teriyaki chicken, chipotle chicken, and healthier alternatives. I have also gotten into Indian cooking too, mostly because of missing my mom's cooking at home.
  - **Working Out**: I had multiple knee surgeries in the past, so I have been trying to keep a good work out routine so that I don't stay out of shape and get become susceptible to more injuries again.

### Research Interests
I have alaways been interested in maps and catography from a very young age, and I am excited to learn more about it in this course. My other hobbies include watching/playing football, spending time with my family, roadtripping, playing video games, cooking, and working out. I have some basic knowledge of Python. My research interest lies on the relation of transportation mode choices and economic/racial disparities are correlated with one another in different cities and what transportation planners can do to remedite some of these injustices. Since I am passionate about Detroit and help return that city into the best version of itself, I would prefer to work on a project related to that.
